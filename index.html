     This was my first blog, and I am excited to share it with you all. Start of my website 8/22/22
</p>


<p>
    Todays date is 9/2/22. I learned so much this week. We learned about saftey,
    and how crucial it is to be safe when working with tools. One mistake might
    be fatal. We learned about the Rube Goldberg Machine. What that is basically
    you have to make a machine that is able to pop a balloon.
    We are also planning to make it ourselves.
    We have the prototype and the desgin all on tinker cad. This
    leads to me talk about tinker cad. This is a 3d desgining app. You build whatever
    you want and then you can 3d print in (obviously)
    

    </p>
     
     Todays date is 9/16/22. We have done so much this week. We cadded out Rube Goldberg
    Machine and we have built it using carboard. We are almost done with it too.
    We have learned how to use the cutter/knife with wood under the cardboard.
    We have to use 3 simple machines for the Rube Goldberg. We have used a slope, lever
    and a wedge. This is what it looks like. 
    
    </p>
    
     <img src="Tinker.png" width="300px" height="200px">
     
     
     </p>
    
    We also did a project where we had to see whos boat lasts in the water the longest
    and it should also have some sort of weight on it. Ours had 18.3 grams and lasted 40
    seconds. It was really bad it was the worst out of all of them. Everyones lasted at least
    3 minutes ours was the worst it sank immeditely. What we did was pin the bottom
    of the boat with 2 huge pins and we thought it would float because its on the pins.
    It didn't. Heres what it looked it. 
    
    </p>

    It's under the markers so you can't really see it but its there.
    
    
    </body>
    
    </p>
    
    
    Todays date is 9/26/22. We finally finished the Rube Goldberg Machine, and
    we competed with each other to see which one works the best and if in the 
    end it can actually pop the balloon. Ours did pop the ballon and there is the video and 
    picture of ours. We used three simple machines which where, an incline plane,
    a lever and a wedge.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    </p>
    
    
    Todays date is 9/30/22. We cadded a animal prosthetic limb. My animal was a 
    whale. My prosethtic was to be placed on the flipper like a cast, it will
    be filed down to make it easier forthem to use and move around in. 
    This is what it looks like.

    Todays date is 10/7/22. This week we had to dissect a computer. Siuneh and I
    paired up and we dissected a computer. Heres what we looked like. The goal
    was to completley dissect the computer then put it all together again, we 
    dissected it but putting it together will be a challenge.

    Todays date is 10/24/22 this weeek we were building a rocket. We basically
    build a rocket with a coke bottle, cardboard, ducktape, hot glue, paper,
    and we made it fly in the air. This is what our rocket look like.

    Todays date is 11/18/2022. For the past 2/3 weeks we have been working on 
    the arduino. Basically we were coding to make light bulbs turn on long story short.
    Here's what ours looked like. For Thanksgiving, on Monday I am going to my best
    friends birthday party and for my thanksgiving dinner, there is going to be 
    turkey, fish, salads and mac and cheese. We don't have any customs but we do 
    give thanks for what we have and that we are grateful for everything we have.

    Todays date is November 10, 2022. All week and like a half we have been learning
    about breadboards and also building/making them. Breadboards are like plugblocks
    that allow you to build temporary circuits. First I made a cad of it, here is
    what it looks like
    
    </p>

    As you can see I was successful because they all turned on.
    Here are the videos of me and my partner making them

     Todays day is 12/2/22. This week we learned about civil engineering.
    Civil engineering is proffesional engineering that deals with construction.
    We are building a spaghetti bridge using only 20 pieces of spaghetti, and
    wood glue. We drew what we are going to build and this is what it 
    looks like.

    Todays date is 12/16/22. This is our final bridge that we ended up with.
    It held about 18 grams of water. This is our slides. You can go check it out
    it shows all our trial and errors and shows all the brisges we made.

   Todays date 1/15/23. It was new year. All over winter break I was hanging out
   with my friends and also I celebrated Christmas and my birthday on Jan 5. I was
   also sick on new years. This week we have learned about business engineering the 
   project is to build an invention that people will invest in. It's shark tank
   but with teachers instead of the actual investors. Our presentation is on canva.
   
   
   
   </p>
   
   
   <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFXks3EIwc/5R19HivQImELYD6R4g7PMg/edit"> this is our presentation on teleportation </a>
   
   </p>

    
    Todays date is 1/19/23. I have learned how hard it is to manage a business.
    It's not that easy everything has to be calculated and a lot of math has to 
    be done.
    Our presentation went good, we presented and we got many offers. We ended
    up with the offer for 20 billion for 10% and to help pay off our debt.
    We used that offer and we decided to give 10% of our company to Tigran. The
    presentation is above if you want to view it. 
    
    
    
    </p>
    
    
    Todays date is 1/27/23. We build non-Newtonian fluids, which is a fluid that
    doesn't follow Newton's law of viscosity. This is what it looked like. We are
    starting a new project. We have to build an arduino car. Our approach is to 
    make a cardboard base with wheels and motors.

    </p>
    
    
    Todays date is 2/3/23. Our design is going to include, a cardboard base,
    4 wheels and 4 motors. On the base the arduino will lie and there will be 
    a sensor that will tell it to avoid obstacles in its way. This is what it looks like.
    I was not here for the post it challenge, I was absent.

    Todays date is 2/10/23. This week we have worked on building the base
    and coding the arduino. This is what it looks like so far.

   Todays date is 2/10/23. For challenge day we were given a water balloon, meter stick, popsicle sticks, 
   and rubber bands. We were given the task to get it across the basketball courts
   without popping it and as fast as possible. It popped at the end. This is what it 
   looks like.

   Todays date is 2/17/23. We have finally finished our cars base. This is what it looks like. 
   Since we are done with the building, we are now going to test it and make improvements.

   </P>
   
   Todays date is 2/24/23. We are currently done with our project. We have made the base and we have
   programmed it. We haven't fully programed it but I am close to finishing it. I have made progress.
   But you saw what it looks like it has not changed from last week. I have also learned that the motor
   contoler bruns out easily. And it works without it being plugged in to the computer because of the battery.
   
   
   </P>
   
   
   Todays date is 3/3/23. We have finished the project. The car went we were able to program it. This week
   we didn't learn anything new. From this project I learned that making an arduino car isnt as easy as I 
   thought it would be. I thought it was easy because we used our resources and we found the code and how to 
   build it. It wasn't that easy because we were limited. In the video you needed 4 wheels and 4 motors. We 
   had 2 for both and then we used cd's to help move, you can look above and see our car and how it ended up to 
   look like. It required a lot of communication. Our car did pretty good, it was able to move and go forward.

   Todays date is 3/24/23. I did not really do much over spring break. I just hung out with some of my friends
   and I also went to the beach with my dad. This week we have started a new project. It's about egg drop. 
   We have to drop the egg from 3 stories and hope it does not break.
   </p>
   
  
   
   </p>
   
   
   We have also learned about a simulations website. The website was about science, physics and stuff like that.
   It was pretty cool here is the link to the website. 
   
    <a href="https://www.new3jcn.com/simulation.html"> This is the link to the physics website </a>
   
   
   </P>
   
   
   Also here is my summary of the website and what I did. Here is the link to it.

   </p> 
   
   Todays date is 4/14/23. We have finished our egg drop project. We were able to make sure the egg doesn't break
   and we started a new project. I dont have any vidoes of the egg drop project but I have a picture of what it looked like.
   Here is what it looked like.

   We have to build a boat big enough for me and Narek so we don't sink in the pool
   So far we have only done the cad. Here is what it looks like. We havent really started the boat
   because the cad and the boat have to be percise we only have collected the materials so far and we are starting
   next week.

   Todays date is 4/20. We have started working on the boat we have made progress. We have made the seats for me and Narek
   and we are going to start making the base as to where the seats are going to go. We have changed the desgin of the boat 
   here is what the new design looks like.

   This week we have started working on the base for the boat. We have also finished our prototype to what
   the boat is going to like. This is what the prototype looks like. We are going to be testing it next week 
   to see if it does not sink, if it does not sink then we will use the prototype and finish the boat

   This is the progress for our boat so far. 
   
   
   
   
   </P>
   
   
   
   Todays date is 5/4/23. We finally tested our boats. This is the video of us testing the boat. Since it didn't
   work we decided we are going to stick with our original design. But we made our prototype to see if the 
   design would work since it doesn't we will stick with our cad the original design.

      Todays date is 5/15/23. Over these past couple of days we have managed to put up the sides. We will be
      able to finish it next week. We have also worked on something new. We have done this assignment. It 
      was called the paper roller coaster. So what you have to do is make a roller coaster that can take
      a marble from the top all the way down to the bottom without it falling out. The prettier it is
      and the more loops there are the higher the points you will get. You get only one roll of tape
      and unlimited paper. We were given two class periods for this. Here is what it looks like. And here is
      what our boat looks like. 
      
      
      </p>
      
      
     <img src="paperrollercoaster.jpg" width="250px" height="300px">
     
     </p>
     
     
     Todays date is 5/26/23. We have finally finished the boat. We have done the sides with two layers
     and Mr Poole was kind enough to give us the black gorrila glue tape. Which is one of the best tapes
     in the market so we could use that to strengthen our boat. I decided to do two layers instead of one
     and it worked out well. Here is what our boat looks like.

     </p>
     
     Since we were busy working on the boat all week we weren't able to do the bookstand. Also while finishing
     the boat Mr Poole made us write a boat analysis about the project overall. Here is the link to it.

      </P>
      
      
      Todays date is 6/1/22. This is the last website update. WE have finished our boats and we have raced.
      Everyone did well and almost all the boats went up and down. Here is the link so you can view everyones boats
      and how everyone did. our video is there too. I am surprised we did that well but then again it was 6 layers.
      I had an amazing semester. I had so much fun. I am so glad I took this class. This is my last website update yay.
