    Todays date is 9/2/22. I learned so much this week. We learned about saftey,
    and how crucial it is to be safe when working with tools. One mistake might
    be fatal. We learned about the Rube Goldberg Machine. What that is basically
    you have to make a machine that is able to pop a balloon.
    We are also planning to make it ourselves.
    We have the prototype and the desgin all on tinker cad. This
    leads to me talk about tinker cad. This is a 3d desgining app.
