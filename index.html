    Todays date is 9/2/22. I learned so much this week. We learned about saftey,
    and how crucial it is to be safe when working with tools. One mistake might
    be fatal. We learned about the Rube Goldberg Machine. What that is basically
    you have to make a machine that is able to pop a balloon.
    We are also planning to make it ourselves.
    We have the prototype and the desgin all on tinker cad. This
    leads to me talk about tinker cad. This is a 3d desgining app. You build whatever
    you want and then you can 3d print in (obviously)

     Todays date is 9/16/22. We have done so much this week. We cadded out Rube Goldberg
    Machine and we have built it using carboard. We are almost done with it too.
    We have learned how to use the cutter/knife with wood under the cardboard.
    We have to use 3 simple machines for the Rube Goldberg. We have used a slope, lever
    and a wedge. This is what it looks like.

    We also did a project where we had to see whos boat lasts in the water the longest
    and it should also have some sort of weight on it. Ours had 18.3 grams and lasted 40
    seconds. It was really bad it was the worst out of all of them. Everyones lasted at least
    3 minutes ours was the worst it sank immeditely. What we did was pin the bottom
    of the boat with 2 huge pins and we thought it would float because its on the pins.
    It didn't. Heres what it looked it.
