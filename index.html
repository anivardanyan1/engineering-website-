     This was my first blog, and I am excited to share it with you all. Start of my website 8/22/22

    Todays date is 9/2/22. I learned so much this week. We learned about saftey,
    and how crucial it is to be safe when working with tools. One mistake might
    be fatal. We learned about the Rube Goldberg Machine. What that is basically
    you have to make a machine that is able to pop a balloon.
    We are also planning to make it ourselves.
    We have the prototype and the desgin all on tinker cad. This
    leads to me talk about tinker cad. This is a 3d desgining app. You build whatever
    you want and then you can 3d print in (obviously)

     Todays date is 9/16/22. We have done so much this week. We cadded out Rube Goldberg
    Machine and we have built it using carboard. We are almost done with it too.
    We have learned how to use the cutter/knife with wood under the cardboard.
    We have to use 3 simple machines for the Rube Goldberg. We have used a slope, lever
    and a wedge. This is what it looks like.

    We also did a project where we had to see whos boat lasts in the water the longest
    and it should also have some sort of weight on it. Ours had 18.3 grams and lasted 40
    seconds. It was really bad it was the worst out of all of them. Everyones lasted at least
    3 minutes ours was the worst it sank immeditely. What we did was pin the bottom
    of the boat with 2 huge pins and we thought it would float because its on the pins.
    It didn't. Heres what it looked it.

    It's under the markers so you can't really see it but its there.

    Todays date is 9/26/22. We finally finished the Rube Goldberg Machine, and
    we competed with each other to see which one works the best and if in the 
    end it can actually pop the balloon. Ours did pop the ballon and there is the video and 
    picture of ours. We used three simple machines which where, an incline plane,
    a lever and a wedge.

    Todays date is 9/30/22. We cadded a animal prosthetic limb. My animal was a 
    whale. My prosethtic was to be placed on the flipper like a cast, it will
    be filed down to make it easier forthem to use and move around in. 
    This is what it looks like.

    Todays date is 10/7/22. This week we had to dissect a computer. Siuneh and I
    paired up and we dissected a computer. Heres what we looked like. The goal
    was to completley dissect the computer then put it all together again, we 
    dissected it but putting it together will be a challenge.

    Todays date is 10/24/22 this weeek we were building a rocket. We basically
    build a rocket with a coke bottle, cardboard, ducktape, hot glue, paper,
    and we made it fly in the air. This is what our rocket look like.

    Todays date is 11/18/2022. For the past 2/3 weeks we have been working on 
    the arduino. Basically we were coding to make light bulbs turn on long story short.
    Here's what ours looked like. For Thanksgiving, on Monday I am going to my best
    friends birthday party and for my thanksgiving dinner, there is going to be 
    turkey, fish, salads and mac and cheese. We don't have any customs but we do 
    give thanks for what we have and that we are grateful for everything we have.
